        "description": "In React v16.3 there has been significant changes in component lifecycle methods. If you are using React greater than 16.3 please refer the following blog post. The lifecycle methods are various methods which are invoked at different phases of the lifecycle of a component. Suppose if we are creating the YouTube app, then obviously our app will use the network to buffer the videos and it spends the battery power (letâ€™s assume only these two). If the user switches to another application after playing the video, then being the awesome developers, we should make sure we are using the resources like network and battery in the most efficient manner. Whenever the user switches to another application, we can stop/pause the buffering of the video, which will stop using the network and battery. componentWillMount is executed just before the React Component is about to mount on the DOM. Hence, after this method the component will mount. All the things that you want to do before a component mounts has to be defined here. This method is executed once in a lifecycle of a component and before first render. Usage: componentWillMount is used for initializing the states or props, there is a huge debate going on to merge it with the constructor. render mounts the component onto the browser. This is a pure method, which means it gives the same output every time the same input is provided.",
